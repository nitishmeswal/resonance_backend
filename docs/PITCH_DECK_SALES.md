# 💰 RESONANCE - Sales & Investment Pitch Deck

---

## 🎯 The Problem

### Music is deeply personal, yet socially invisible

- **83%** of people say music taste matters in friendships & relationships
- **You pass by people** with amazing music taste every day — and never know
- **Dating apps** focus on photos, not real compatibility
- **Social apps** don't leverage real-time behavior

> "I wish I could meet people who actually get my music taste."
> — Every music lover, ever

---

## 💡 The Solution

### Resonance: Discover people through music, not photos

**Real-time music discovery that connects you with nearby listeners based on what you're playing RIGHT NOW.**

| Before Resonance | With Resonance |
|------------------|----------------|
| See stranger's face on app | See stranger's current song |
| Swipe based on photos | Match based on music taste |
| Awkward "what music do you like?" | Instant vibe check |
| No way to find music soulmates | Location-based discovery |
